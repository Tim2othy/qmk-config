# How to update the layout

Edit the `c` in this repository. Then copy it over to the folder and replace the previous version.

Then using the terminal QMK MSYS, compile the file and flash it at the same time by entering `qmk flash`, and pressing the activating button on the keyboard.

## Debugging

- If everything is seemingly working but nothing happens after flashing the keyboard:
    - Checheck if `#define MASTER_RIGHT` is missing or commented out from `config.h` if yes add that line back in.




# Problems and Updates


## After latest update

It seems to all work quite well now although there are, of course, many things that I am not used to yet.

For now I think my main confusion is the cont and the shift buttons.

I have shift above cont as I am used to, but now I have shift on the same hight as a normally it was one below and cont is 2 below. So all the time I want to press shift and i accidentally press cont.

But I think the reverse doesn't havppen as one would expect.

Ok.lr

copy and paste are intuitive. And i will aprobably get used to the whole shiftc contn thing fairly quickly.


The second thing is space and backspace.

So space makes sense.87978998nnn7

But when I want To use backspace it s a bit confusing.
